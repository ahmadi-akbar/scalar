# Introduction
## Welcome to Scalar: The OpenAPI Company
![Scalar](./scalarapp.png)
Scalar is a platform to turn your OpenAPI document into a world class developer experience of: Docs, SDKs & Registry. Focus on making your API & let Scalar be the modern platform to make onboarding, managing & integrating your API seamless.

We believe in open-source & open-standards. We built our entire platform off these values, so when you bring in your OpenAPI document we don’t translate into our own proprietary standard, we actually keep the OpenAPI document alive.

## Intro to Scalar
Here’s a high level overview of what we mean by building a world-class API from your OpenAPI document.

Our open-source API References are the go to modern interactive API Documentation product for OpenAPI. Fully customizable with CSS variables, fully interactive with an embedded API Client & we even built our own OpenAPI parser so we have the fastest rendering out there.

### Scalar SDKs
Want to generate world-class SDKs in over 9+ languages: TypeScript, Go, Python, Java, etc.

Bring an OpenAPI document to get SDKs fully managed in Git, add custom overlays or configuration, so your users can get started in their favorite programming language.

### Scalar Registry
Once you upload an OpenAPI Document to Scalar, it lives on our Registry. It can be a public or private document but it is the source of truth for all of our products. You can upload new versions, deploy Docs + SDKs from it, add Spectral Rules & give access to specific users.

Learn more here.
